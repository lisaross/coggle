# Video Generation Prompting Templates

## Core Pattern
Think like a director: temporal structure, camera movement, shot composition.

### Storyboard Template
```
Scene: [overall description]

0s: [opening shot - subject, setting, camera position]
3s: [camera movement or action change]
6s: [climax or reveal]
9s: [closing shot]

Style: [cinematic/documentary/animated]
Mood: [atmosphere description]
```

### Single Shot Template
```
[Shot type] of [subject] [action], [camera movement], [setting], [lighting], [style]
```

### Example
```
Wide establishing shot of a futuristic Tokyo street, camera slowly dollies forward through neon-lit crowds, rain falling, reflections on wet pavement, Blade Runner aesthetic, night scene
```

### Camera Terms
- Movement: dolly, pan, tilt, crane, tracking, handheld, steadicam
- Shots: wide, medium, close-up, extreme close-up, over-the-shoulder
- Angles: low angle, high angle, Dutch angle, bird's eye, worm's eye

### Key Principles
- Specify temporal progression (beginning → middle → end)
- Include camera movement explicitly
- Describe lighting and atmosphere
- Keep scenes focused (one main action per shot)
